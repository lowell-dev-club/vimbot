# TO MAKE A DISCORD APPLICATION AND BOT GO TO THIS LINK:
# https://discord.com/developers/applications

# Here we're making our imports from discord
# Also getting our discord token which we have kept secret
# Important to hide key or else bad stuff happens

# Here we can create functions for when the user calls the bot with a specific command
# as you can see we can call the bot with the prefix '.'

# There are specific events such as on_ready() and on_member_join()
# where the event will trigger a callback function that WE provide
